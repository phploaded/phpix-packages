# PHPix
PHPix is a touch enabled Photo and Youtube gallery system which can also be used as a mobile friendly CMS. The basic idea was to replace smartphone's built in gallery so that your photos can be accessed and viewed any time, with or without sharing publicly, hosted on your own server. Please only save below file:

<a download href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phploaded/PHPix/master/phpix-install.php">phpix-install.php</a>

Upload that PHP file to your server, where you want to install PHPix then access it from browser to start installing. 
Example http://your-website-path.com/phpix-install.php
